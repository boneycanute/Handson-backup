### JS Documents Practice Hands-on

For the given HTML and CSS code, write JavaScript code following the instructions to make it appear the same as the resource link with the same functionality.

### Instructions
1. When the `#btn` is clicked, retrieve a quote from the quotes array and add it inside the `.quote` child `p` element. This should happen in a sequential order, meaning that the first click adds the first quote, the second click adds the second quote, and so on. Once the number of clicks exceeds the number of quotes in the array, the process starts again from the first quote.

##### Follow all the given instructions and pass all the tests to complete this project.
