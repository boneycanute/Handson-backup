## Table Tag II - Practice 

Create a table consisting of "thead" and "tbody", where "thead" contains 2 rows, and each of those 2 rows consists of 3 columns. "tbody" consists of 3 rows, and each row has a different number of columns. Assign the respective colspan and rowspan to each column as mentioned in the instructions. Additionally, apply attributes such as border, cellspacing, cellpadding, and background color to the table.

### Instructions 

1. Title: "Tables with rowspan/colspan practice2"
2. Create a "table" tag.
3. Give it a border attribute with a value of '2', cellspacing with a value of '4', cellpadding with a value of '4', set the background color of the table to 'skyblue', and align it in the center.
4. Create a "thead" tag and add two table rows inside it with ids 'row1' and 'row2'.
5. Inside the row with id 'row1', the 1st Table Heading is 'Name', the 2nd Table Heading is 'Grades', and the 3rd Table Heading is 'Average'.
6. The 'Name' heading should have a colspan of '2' (spanning across 2 vertical columns), the 'Grades' heading should have a colspan of '3' (spanning across 3 horizontal columns), and the 'Average' heading should have a colspan of '2' (spanning across 2 vertical columns).
7. Inside the row with id 'row2', the 1st Table Heading is 'English', the 2nd Table Heading is 'Computer', and the 3rd Table Heading is 'Math'.
8. Create a "tbody" tag and add three table rows inside it with ids 'row3', 'row4', and 'row5'.
9. Inside the row with id 'row3', add 5 columns: the 1st column is 'John Doe', the 2nd column is '85', the 3rd column is '90', the 4th column is '80', and the 5th column is '85'.
10. The fourth column '85' should have a rowspan of '2' (spanning across 2 vertical cells).
11. Inside the row with id 'row4', add 3 columns: the 1st column is '90', the 2nd column is '80', and the 3rd column is '90'.
12. Inside the row with id 'row5', add 5 columns: the 1st column is 'Williamson', the 2nd column is '95', the 3rd column is '85', the 4th column is '90', and the 5th column is '90'.

Follow all the given instructions and pass all the tests to complete this project.

### Test Cases:
